# Lounesart

Just a curious mind exploring cybersecurity, understanding how things work, and gaining control over technology. Little by little, I learn by breaking and fixing things, tinkering it all together. It's not always about the outcome, it's the motion itself that sets me free.

**Current Obsessions:**  
`HTB Machines` | `OWASP TOP-10` | `Bash/Python Automation` | `Privacy & Anonymity`
